== Why the hell we decided to use AsciiDoc

* We wanted to make writing as simple as possible, as writing an email (that's why not LaTeX or DocBook).
* At the same time powerful enough to be able to publish content as:
** HTML 
** PDF 
** ebook (epub) 
** or even as a regular, printed paper book 
(that's why not Markdown).
* Standard tools, popular in industry, used by professional publishers, e.g. http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/about[O'Reilly].
* Easy versionable, publicly available (GitHub), cross-platform, easily editable even directly on web page using only a browser (that's why not MS Word)

== Basic how-to

Insightful introduction into AsciiDoc: http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/.
Read it to learn:

* Which editor to use
* The basic structure of an AsciiDoc document
* How to add other structural elements such as lists, block quotes and source code

However, we need to define our own guidelines to make docs formatting consistent accross all articles. The basic rules are as follows:

* Main sections of the finger print are:
** Development
** Project Management
** Quality Assurance
* The top of each chapter file should begin with a chapter title preceded by two equals signs. Itâ€™s good practice to always include a unique ID string above the chapter title, surrounded in double brackets, for example: http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000065/ch04.html#text_markup[src]

* Within a chapter, the first and highest heading level uses three equals signs: http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000065/ch04.html#text_markup[src]
